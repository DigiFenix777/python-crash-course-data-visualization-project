# Data Visualization Project ‚Äì Python Crash Course (Project 2)

This project is a personal implementation of the second data visualization project from *Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition* by Eric Matthes. It demonstrates the use of Python libraries like `Matplotlib` and `Pygal` to generate dynamic and meaningful data visualizations from CSV and API data sources.

## üìå Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to reinforce skills in:
- Data wrangling and formatting
- Creating static and interactive visualizations
- Using Python libraries such as `csv`, `json`, `requests`, `Pygal`, and `Matplotlib`
- Writing modular, readable, and well-documented Python code

This project also serves as part of my learning portfolio in data visualization and Python development.

## üß™ Features

- Pulls data from external APIs and local CSV files
- Visualizes weather trends, earthquakes, and/or COVID-19 cases (based on selected chapter)
- Exports visualizations as PNG or SVG
- Modular code for easier expansion or reuse

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib
- Pygal
- Requests
- JSON and CSV parsing
- Git & GitHub
